"""
So what am I going to work on now?
Make the program keep asking if the user wants to play until the user says NO.
So I have to use a while loop. What is the pseudocode?

The while loop variables so far are integers. But I want mine to be strings. 
While loop definition: we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.
So I have to use while True.
With indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop is executed isnâ€™t specified explicitly in advance. Rather, the designated block is executed repeatedly as long as some condition is met.
I feel like the while True should start at line 6 but that's just asking which level to start. 
I am still gonna end up using recursion to call the ten_questions function. 
Unless if I combine main() and ten_questions() together as one function but that would be too bloated for a function.
